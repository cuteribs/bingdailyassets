This hidden gem in the foothills of the Pyrenees has about 130 residents and is popular with tourists, thanks to the 12th-century Church of Santiago. A national monument with intricate stone carvings of beasts and religious scenes, the church was never finished but is considered one of this region's most beautiful Romanesque temples. If you consider yourself a history buff, a rock climber, or both, put Agüero on your travel list.",

They hunt in pods, family groups of up to 40 individuals that work together using special hunting techniques sometimes likened to packs of wolves. Despite their scary name, they almost never attack humans and there are no documented cases of wild orcas killing anyone. The name 'killer whale' is thought to come from Spanish sailors who saw groups of them hunting big whales. Orcas are also the largest member of the oceanic dolphin family, Delphinidae.",

During heavy rain, they are unable to hunt because their feathers aren't waterproof, leaving them vulnerable to starvation during long periods of wet weather.

The Easter egg has long been a symbol of fertility and rebirth, but exactly why people started decorating them is unclear. One theory is that, because animal products were not eaten during the religious Lenten season, people would hard-boil the eggs and decorate them with dye and wax, until they could be eaten at Easter. A more opulent type of decorated egg, Fabergé eggs, were famously created as bejeweled Easter gifts to the Russian imperial family. Our homepage image shows eggs from Lithuania, where people use traditional methods to paint patterns with wax using sharp objects or etch patterns into dyed eggs.",

It fell out of popular practice in the 1920s but eventually regained popularity—partly due to marketing—and was set as a permanent national observance by President Richard Nixon in 1972.

Via Krupp's panoramic vistas of the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Faraglioni rock formations, and the lush landscape of the island have drawn admiration for generations.

This tourist destination in Castilla-La Mancha is famous for its rocky ridge, known as Cerro Calderico, crowned with 12 white windmills. The windmills are thought to have inspired Cervantes to write the famous scene in which Don Quixote mistakes them for an army of giants. With their stone walls and wooden blades, some date back to the 16th century, when they were built to grind grain.",

If it sounds like stepping into a southern Gothic novel, you're on the right track: The cemetery featured in John Berendt's 1994 bestseller 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.' Among the famous figures resting here is poet Conrad Aiken, whose grave is mentioned in the novel. His tombstone is a bench, said to have been designed to allow poetry lovers somewhere to sit to enjoy a drink in these soul-stirring surroundings.",

The park is named after three striking granite peaks that reach up to 8,200 feet above sea level but boasts many other spectacular mountains.

The Red Shirt Table, at 3,340 feet, is the highest point in the park, which was established on this day in 1978. It protects 379 square miles of rocky buttes, pinnacles, and prairies.
