This hidden gem in the foothills of the Pyrenees has about 130 residents and is popular with tourists, thanks to the 12th-century Church of Santiago. A national monument with intricate stone carvings of beasts and religious scenes, the church was never finished but is considered one of this region's most beautiful Romanesque temples. If you consider yourself a history buff, a rock climber, or both, put Agüero on your travel list.",

They hunt in pods, family groups of up to 40 individuals that work together using special hunting techniques sometimes likened to packs of wolves. Despite their scary name, they almost never attack humans and there are no documented cases of wild orcas killing anyone. The name 'killer whale' is thought to come from Spanish sailors who saw groups of them hunting big whales. Orcas are also the largest member of the oceanic dolphin family, Delphinidae.",

During heavy rain, they are unable to hunt because their feathers aren't waterproof, leaving them vulnerable to starvation during long periods of wet weather.

The Easter egg has long been a symbol of fertility and rebirth, but exactly why people started decorating them is unclear. One theory is that, because animal products were not eaten during the religious Lenten season, people would hard-boil the eggs and decorate them with dye and wax, until they could be eaten at Easter. A more opulent type of decorated egg, Fabergé eggs, were famously created as bejeweled Easter gifts to the Russian imperial family. Our homepage image shows eggs from Lithuania, where people use traditional methods to paint patterns with wax using sharp objects or etch patterns into dyed eggs.",

It fell out of popular practice in the 1920s but eventually regained popularity—partly due to marketing—and was set as a permanent national observance by President Richard Nixon in 1972.

Today, this towering Norway spruce is adorned with over 50,000 multicolored LED lights and topped with a Swarovski crystal star. The illumination of the 80-foot tree is a full-blown extravaganza with musical performances and celebrity sightings. Its mesmerizing glow marks the official arrival of the holiday season in the city that never sleeps, and you don't want to miss it!",

Known for their crisp texture and sweet-tart flavor, apples belong to the Rosaceae family. These fruits come in a variety of colors, from vibrant reds to golden yellows and bright greens. Each type boasts its unique flavor profile, from the tangy Granny Smith to the sweetness of Fuji. These fruits are rich in dietary fiber, antioxidants, and essential vitamins like vitamin C and vitamin K, promoting overall health and well-being. Whether you like them fresh, baked in your favorite desserts, or pressed into cider, apples are a classic culinary delight.",

These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play.",

The non-profit organization Pollinator Partnership initiated Pollinator Week to raise awareness about the protection of these creatures. This celebration is now being joined by other programs and educational events around the country. Should we care? Absolutely! From fruits and veggies to nuts, chocolate, or sugarcane, there are plenty of ingredients in our diet that are brought to us by pollinators.",

The local dhow builders offer a glimpse into an artisanal craft that has sailed through generations. Venture deeper and you'll find lush spice farms where the air tingles with the scent of nutmeg and black pepper. Here, traditional Swahili dishes, including nyama choma, a roasted meat dish, and samaki wa kaupaka, fish with coconut sauce, blend spices with the bounty of the sea and land. As the sun sets, bonfires flicker into life and the island pulses with Taarab, a fusion of African, Arabic, and Indian music. With so much to see, Zanzibar proves that variety really is the spice of life.",

These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes, and seasonally flooded savannas. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles, and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping the populations of their prey under control. More caimans mean fewer piranhas, which attack cattle, and fewer capybaras, which can cause crop damage.",

These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing, and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers, and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, featured in today's image. Today, on National Bison Day, observed every first Saturday in November, we honor these noble creatures—a testament to the American spirit and the monumental conservation efforts to save them.",

Over centuries, this interaction caused calcium carbonate to build up, forming tufa spires above the lake's surface. To preserve the tufa towers, the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve was established in 1981.",

March 25 is the day the One Ring was destroyed, bringing down Sauron and ending his dark reign. The observation was launched in 2003 to encourage people to explore J.R.R. Tolkien's works. Schools, libraries, and fans worldwide take part, reading passages aloud, discussing favorite moments, and diving into the rich lore of Middle-earth. Some go all out with themed events, cosplay, and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honor Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?",

The splendid leaf frog (aka splendid tree frog) is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet, and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of color mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. It spends its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights.",

Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion.

The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture, and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young, and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore.",
